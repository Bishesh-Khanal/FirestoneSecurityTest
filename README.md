# FirestoneSecurityTest

I addressed the vulnerability scanning requirement for my  Firestore security testing solution through an automated testing framework that specifically targets common security issues in Firebase/Firestore applications. The solution implements five core security test cases using Jest and Firebase Rules. Unit Testing: authentication bypass prevention (ensuring unauthenticated users cannot write data), authorization validation (verifying users can only access their own documents), permission escalation prevention (confirming users cannot modify others' content), and most importantly for vulnerability scanning, an automated XSS input validation test that systematically injects common cross-site scripting payloads to verify the system properly handles malicious input without sanitization issues. Since there's no SQL being executed anywhere in the system (Firestore is a NoSQL database), there's no attack vector for SQL injection to exist so that requirement was not focused on. The framework generates structured vulnerability reports in both JSON and human-readable formats, providing clear pass/fail status for each security test case, effectively automating the detection of common web application vulnerabilities like XSS while ensuring proper authorization controls are in place, all while maintaining responsible testing practices by running against local emulators rather than production systems.
